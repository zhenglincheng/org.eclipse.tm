/**
 * The class {@link LocalTerminalProcess} is a customized {@link RuntimeProcess} for use by the
 * {@link org.eclipse.tm.internal.terminal.local.LocalTerminalConnector}. It serves the purpose of
 * preventing the {@link org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.DebugUIPlugin DebugUIPlugin}'s
 * {@link org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.views.console.ProcessConsoleManager ProcessConsoleManager}
 * from allocating a Console view in addition to the Terminal view that serves as the program's main
 * I/O device. <p>
 * Unfortunately, the Process Console Manager determines the need for a Console view by checking the
 * {@link IStreamsProxy} of the process for <code>null</code>. If the process has a non-null
 * {@link IStreamsProxy} a console will be automatically allocated. This is problematic because
 * the Local Terminal Connector requires an {@link IStreamsProxy} but obviously not an additional
 * console view. It would have been better if the Process Console Manager would check the
 * corresponding attributes in the launch configuration rather than checking the
 * {@link IStreamsProxy} of the process. The work-around for now is to remove the underlying
 * process from the launch. No console will be allocated for a launch that doesn't have a process
 * associated with it. Consequently, a currently running terminal launch will appear in the Debug
 * view's list of active launches but the view will not show any child elements (and the element
 * cannot be expanded, either). The {@link LocalTerminalProcessRegistry} keeps track of which
 * {@link LocalTerminalProcess} is associated with a particular launch. Client code that needs to
 * find the process of a launch can obtain it through that registry. <p>
 * However, for a launch to be properly terminated it needs to have at least one process that can
 * be terminated. Launches that do not have any processes associated with them are not considered
 * terminated and actually terminating them is not possible. To work around this secondary issue,
 * the process is added back to its launch just before the launch is terminated. This activity is
 * performed by {@link LocalTerminalProcessRegistry#addProcessBackToFinishedLaunch(ILaunch)}. To
 * prevent a console allocation during this last step, the {@link #resetStreamsProxy()} method will
 * be invoked, which will cause subsequent calls to {@link IProcess#getStreamsProxy()} to return
 * <code>null</code>. After the launch is terminated it will appear in the Debug view with the
 * terminated process as its child element. The exit value of the terminal process can also be seen
 * in that view. <p>
 * {@link #getStreamsProxy()} will also return <code>null</code> during initialization of a
 * {@link LocalTerminalProcess} object until after the
 * {@link RuntimeProcess#RuntimeProcess(ILaunch, Process, String, Map) super constructor} invocation
 * has been completed. This disables a code path that caused a Console view to pop up when the
 * {@link org.eclipse.debug.core.model.IStreamMonitor IStreamMonitor} already contained data (like,
 * for example, a shell's initial prompt) when the <code>ProcessConsoleManager</code> received an
 * {@link org.eclipse.debug.core.ILaunchListener#launchChanged(ILaunch)} notification (which cannot
 * be avoided). See <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/314607">https://bugs.eclipse.org/314607</a>
 * for additional details. <p/>
 *
 * This solution for preventing standard consoles from being opened does certainly not deserve the
 * cleanliness award for straightforward coding, but at least it doesn't rely on internal API at
 * this point. Ideally, the whole issue should be resolved with some sort of console renderer
 * extension point as proposed in bug 242373 (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=242373).
