Important note:
---------------
This README is for terminal.serial version 1.0.0 and later, corresponding
to RSE downloads after 2.0M4. Instructions for previous versions (using
Sun javacomm / javax.comm package instead of gnu.io) are still available from
http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/org.eclipse.tm.core/terminal/org.eclipse.tm.terminal.serial/README.txt?root=DSDP_Project&view=markup&pathrev=R1_0_1


Prerequisites:
--------------
In order to compile and run this plugin, RXTX has to be installed.
There are two options: Either installing RXTX as an Eclipse plugin,
or installing RXTX as a JVM extension. For installation as plugin,
you can download a ZIP archive or use the Update Manager; if an
Eclipse plugin is not available for your Platform, you'll need
to install RXTX into the JVM (option B, below).

In either case, once RXTX is installed, you'll need to quit and 
re-start Eclipse PDE in order to recompute the classpath.


Option A.1: Installation as an Eclipse Plugin via Update Manager:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* In Eclipse, choose Help > Software Updates...
  - Add New Remote Site: 
       Name = RXTX
       URL  = http://rxtx.qbang.org/eclipse/
  - Finish, select proper version, Install All
 

Option A.2: Installation as an Eclipse Plugin via Download:
-----------------------------------------------------------
* Download RXTX SDK or Runtime ZIP from
     http://rxtx.qbang.org/eclipse/downloads/
  and extract it into your Eclipse installation. The download
  link mentioned also has a README with version and licensing
  information.


Option B: Installation as a JVM Extension:
------------------------------------------
* Get RXTX binaries from
  ftp://ftp.qbang.org/pub/rxtx/rxtx-2.1-7-bins-r2.zip
* Copy RXTXcomm.jar into $JRE/lib/ext
* Copy the native libs for your Platform (*.so, *.jnilib, *.dll)
  into the respective native lib folder of your RSE 
* More installation instructions are at
  http://rxtx.qbang.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page
* More downloads for other platforms (currently about 30)
  are available from the "ToyBox" link on
  http://users.frii.com/jarvi/rxtx/download.html
