Introduction
--------------
The attached plugin (org.eclipse.rse.remotecdt) builds on top of CDT and integrates with RSE to introduce
 a "Remote C/C++ Application" launch configuration. This launch configuration relies on the shell and file
 services of the RSE connections.
 
The "Remote C/C++ Application" launch configuration enables the user to select from a list of RSE 
 connections which have the shell service available. For a debug launch, the binary is downloaded
 to the remote using the file service of the RSE connection, gdbserver is automatically started 
 on the remote using the shell service and a gdb debug connection is establised.  For a run launch,
 the binary is downloaded to the remote using the file service and then it is invoked using the shell
 service.


In the future, an RSE file service should be used in the future to select where the remote download
 should take place. Right now the remote path is entered manually in a text field.


System Prerequisites
------------------
Local Host
  A. It is necessary to create an RSE connection which has the file and shell services 
     available.

Remote Host
  A. gdbserver is on the path.
  B. port 2345 is available to use. gdbserver will use this port.


Installation of Necessary Eclipse Components
---------------------------------

1. Install Eclipse 3.2.
2. Install CDT 3.1.
3. Install RSE.  This is the procedure I followed.
 A. Checkout RSE from the repository using anonymous username.
 B. Import the plugin directory and build all the RSE plugins.

4. Import the Remote CDT plugin and build that.


Using
----------

A "Remote C++ Application" launch configuration will be available.  
After building a binary which will run on your remote, try using this 
configuration to run or debug it.

Current Limitations
-----------

There is no way to tell when the command on the remote has finished 
running.  As a result, the "Remote Shell" process will be left active
after the debug session dies and needs to be terminated manually. The
run process also needs to be terminated manually for the same reason.
