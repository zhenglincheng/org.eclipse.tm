<h1>DataStore Overview</h1>
<p>
The RSE uses the concept of <b>subsystems</b> as a common abstraction for remote tooling.  Subsystems provide
public interfaces that are called when some remote tool or resource needs to be communicated with.  As long as
the appropriate public interfaces are implemented, the means of communicating with these remote tools and resources
is up to the developer of the subsystem.  Whatever that might be, some kind of communication layer is required
to access tools on the host.  One such means that is used by existing RSE Subsystems and can be reused is the
DataStore framework.
</p>
<p>
The <b>DataStore</b> communications framework is used to provide remote access and tooling for the Remote System Explorer.
It is a communications layer, in-memory data repository and a pluggable tooling framework.  While Eclipse provides
the ability for local tools to plug into the Eclipse workbench, DataStore provides the ability to integrate
remote tools into the Remote System Explorer.  When implementing subsystem APIs, a particular implementation
may provide remote function by leveraging DataStore.

<p>
In an RSE subsystem, the goal of the DataStore is to provide the bridge to tools and resources on the host.
To interact with a remote tool, a DataStore client communicates over a network with a DataStore server.  Data and
commands are transferred between the client and server via the DataStore communication layer.  Information
that is communicated between each side is kept in memory with the DataStore repository. Both the client and server DataStores
have this repository and it is the responsibility of the DataStore communication layer to keep the contents
of each of these repositories in sync.  All the DataStore data on the server side is replicated to the client and
and vice versa.
</p>
<p>
The DataStore framework is generic in the sense that it can be used to facilitate any kind of remote tooling.  There are
no specialized APIs or artifacts that are geered towards a particular use.  How DataStore is used is determined by the
tool extensions, <a href="Miners.html">Miners</a>.  <a href="Miners.html">Miners</a> are typically either adapters to
tools on the host or are tools themselves.  These extensions determine the meaning of data used to represent objects,
relationships and the commands that can be issued on the represented objects.  <a href="Miners.html">Miners</a> shape the
DataStore by contributing <a href="Schemas.html">schemas</a> to the pool of information in a DataStore repository.
Because the client and server DataStore repositories are synchronized, the DataStore clients
have access to the miner <a href="Schemas.html">schemas</a> and, using that information, they are able to communicate with the tools on the host.
Because the server has access to those miner <a href="Schemas.html">schemas</a>, each <a href="Miners.html">Miners</a> may also communicate with
other <a href="Miners.html">Miners</a> on the host in the same way a client can.
</p>
<p>
A Filesystem miner can shape the DataStore by contributing a <a href="Schemas.html">schema</a> that
describes file systems and how they should be interacted with.  The <a href="Schemas.html">schema</a> could describe
files, folders, properties of files and relationships between them as well as commands for querying folders or renaming files.
An RSE subsystem, can then provide browsing capabilities to a remote file system by sending commands
via the DataStore client to the Filesystem Miner on the host.  Another <a href="Miners.html">miner</a> can
contribute its own <a href="Schemas.html">schema</a> or extend the existing Filesystem Miner <a href="Schemas.html">schema</a>
to leverage or contribute to the existing file  system tool.

This guide explains all underlying
artifacts and model of the DataStore, its relationship to RSE, and highlights the
important APIs available for your use.
