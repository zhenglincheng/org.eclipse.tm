<h1>Using the RSE DataStore for Remote Communications</h1>
<div class="p">
This section provides information for tool developers who wish to
add server-side tooling capabilities.  Using the RSE DataStore tooling 
communication framework, server-side extensions can be written.  The Remote System Explorer can be
extended to interface the new server-side extensions.
</div>

<h2>Provisional API</h2>
<div class="p">
<p>Although RSE API has been reviewed and proven useful in earlier proprietary 
versions, we want to give the Open Source Communitiy a chance to provide more
public feedback and help further improving the APIs. Therefore,</p>

<p><b>As of TM / RSE 2.0, all API is considered provisional.</b></p>

<p>This means, that we reserve the right to change any API after TM / RSE 2.0
in a not backward compatible way. We will make every sensible effort to 
keep at least Source API Compatibility intact, but in cases where this would
lead to unnecessary code bloat we will go with API breakage. All such API changes will be voted on
by committers on the <a href="https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/dsdp-tm-dev">
dsdp-tm-dev</a> developer mailing list, and documented in a migration guide
for future releases. We expect that with Community Feedback, we'll reach a 
stable, hardened API for TM 3.0. Please give your feedback on 
<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/">Eclipse Bugzilla</a>
under category DSDP, Product Target Management.</p>
