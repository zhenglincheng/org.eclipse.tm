<h1>Remote System Explorer Extension Points</h1>

<p>
This product is built on the Eclipse platform 
(<A href="http://www.eclipse.org">www.eclipse.org</A>)
and so it offers all the
capabilities of Eclipse. This includes the ability to create new Eclipse plug-ins to contribute
additional functions to Eclipse. You can write plug-ins using Java, using Eclipse itself,
with the Plug-in Development Environment (PDE) perspective. Plug-ins contain a file named <code>plugin.xml</code> that
registers their functions. All such functions are created by use of <b>extension points</b>.
These are either supplied by Eclipse or by other plug-ins. The plugin.xml file describes which extension
points are being exploited by each plug-in, and for each identifies the Java class that supplies the
additional functions. Each extension point identifies a Java interface (or base class) that
classes exploiting the extension point must implement (or extend).
</p>
<p>
There are many Eclipse-supplied extension points described in
this documentation. In addition to the Eclipse extension points, there
are unique Remote System Explorer extension points that enable you to contribute property pages and
pop-up menu actions to remote objects within the Remote Systems view, among other things. The base Eclipse extension
points are not sufficient for these, as they do not allow scoping of those property pages and
actions such that they only appear for certain remote objects meeting specific filtering criteria.
</p>

<p>
Listed below are the most common extension points defined by the Remote System Explorer.
They are further described in the reference section along with others that are more special-purpose.
The ones listed here are specifically designed to make
it easy to contribute functions to the pop-up menus of remote objects displayed in the Remote
Systems view. These extension points are defined by the
<strong>org.eclipse.rse.core</strong> and <strong>org.eclipse.rse.ui</strong> plugins.
