<h1>RSE Services</h1>
<p>
RSE is built on top of a service layer that provides services that access the remote systems.
These service implementations are typically protocol-specific but will obey an interface that defined for that paricular service.
For example, a file service will obey the interface defined in the package
<code>org.eclipse.rse.services.files</code>, but there
exist implementations for the dstore, FTP, and SSH protocols.
</p>
<p>
RSE supplies service definitions for a file service, a shell service for submitting remote commands, a search service, and a process service.
Implementers that which to use different protocols than the ones supplied should use the existing service definitions to fit into the current 
structure.
</p>
<p>
It is not absolutely necessary to have a services layer.
Implementers of subsystems that provide access to resources that in narrow domains
could forgo the creation of explicit service classes and embed the 
support directly in the subsystem.
