<h1>RSE Hosts</h1>
<p>
Hosts, sometimes called "connections", are visible as the top level entities shown in the Remote Systems view.
Hosts are always created referencing a system type.
The system type determines the kinds of services that will be available to that host.
System types are defined by the <code>org.eclipse.rse.core.systemTypes</code> extension point, which lists the <code>subsystemConfigurations</code>
that are valid for type.
</p><p>
Once instantiated, hosts can be connected to their target systems.
This causes the connector services associated with
the subsystems belonging to that host to request connection. 
Disconnect works similarly.
