<h1>RSE Connector Services</h1>
<p>
Connector Services provide the mechanism for maintaining a connection to a particular remote system, requesting whatever credentials are 
required for authentication, and for controlling the persistence of those credentials. A connector service is typically created 
or referenced by a subsystem configuration when a new subsystem instance is being created.
</p><p>
Every subsystem has a connector service. Some subsystems will share a connector service among themselves. 
Subsystems that share a connector service all connect and disconnect at the same time.
For example, a file subsystem and
a shell subsystem that are both using the SSH protocol will share the same connector service instance so that their connections are established and
removed at the same time.
</p><p>
Connector services use credentials providers (see <code>ICredentialsProvider</code>) to establish any credentials needed for authentication to a 
remote system.
