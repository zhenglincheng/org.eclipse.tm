/**
 * This interface represents a handle to a remote file system object,
 * which is either a file or a folder. This interface is similar to
 * a java.io.File object, but with some significant differences:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>This represents a "handle" to the remote file or folder, and allows to
 *        mark special folders as "root" of the file system. For editing purposes,
 *        a local copy of the remote file can be managed. The support for this is
 *        captured in a separate interface, {@link ISystemEditableRemoteObject}.
 *   <li>This interface has no action methods, only property access methods. The action methods
 *        such as delete, rename, list or getRemoteFileObject() are found in the 
 *        {@link IRemoteFileSubSystem} interface. All remote commands/actions are routed
 *        through subsystems in this remote system framework.
 *   <li>Similarly, IRemoteFile handle objects are not constructed directly. They are obtained
 *        from factory methods in {@link IRemoteFileSubSystem#getRemoteFileObject(String, org.eclipse.core.runtime.IProgressMonitor)},
 *        and related methods, which may delegate the actual object creation to an
 *        {@link IHostFileToRemoteFileAdapter} in case of an {@link IFileServiceSubSystem}
 *        instance.
 *   <li>There are no relative names. All names are fully qualified, and include
 *        the root, the path and the file name (unless this is a folder).
 *   <li>There are additional methods for querying the root (ie, c:\) and the
 *        parent directory (unqualified name of the parent directory).
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Note for subsystem providers: this method does not capture the set methods that the
 * RemoteFile class defines. For that, cast to {@link RemoteFile}.
 *
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients. Clients
 *     should subclass the provided {@link RemoteFile} or one of its subclasses
 *     instead. For use with file services (IFileServiceSubSystem), the
 *     {@link AbstractRemoteFile} class must be subclassed.
