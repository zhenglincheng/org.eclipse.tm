	 * By passing in a pre-existing TelnetClient instance, this method allows

	 * the Commons.Net APIs before using RSE to authenticate the client.
	 *
	 * Example:
	 *
	 * <pre>
	 * TelnetClient client = new TelnetClient(&quot;vt100&quot;);
	 * client.addOptionHandler(new EchoOptionHandler(false, true, true, true));
	 * client = fSessionProvider.loginTelnetClient(client, new NullProgressMonitor());
	 * </pre>
	 *
	 * @param client telnet client already created
	 * @param monitor progress monitor
	 * @return authenticated client for the given connection, or
	 *         <code>null</code> in case the user cancelled the login through
	 *         the progress monitor. The passed-in client is disconnected in
	 *         this case.
	 * @throws SystemMessageException in case of an error while authenticating
	 *             (such as timeout, communications error, or failure matching
	 *             expected prompt). The passed-in TelnetClient remains
	 *             connected in this case.
