Application programming interface for creating customized shell process subsystems.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
The package provides support classes for creating customized shell process
subsystems.
<p>The class <b>ShellProcessSubSystemConfiguration</b> is the main factory
for creating a shell process subsystem: a process subsystem that gathers
its data by running commands on a remote system through a shell subsystem
that's registered against the same host. By deriving from it, extenders
can create their customized shell process subsystem configuration which can 
then be registered against their system types. A custom
<b>SubSystemConfigurationAdapter</b> can be registered for UI-specific
customizations. Possible customizations include:
<ul>
<li>Changing the isCaseSensitive() method for system types that
  are not of UNIX style.</li>
<li>Registering pre-defined filters through a filter pool manager.</li>
<li>Wrapping the created ProcessServiceSubSystem or LinuxShellProcessService 
  in a delegate for modifying operation of the Subsystem.</li>
</ul>
