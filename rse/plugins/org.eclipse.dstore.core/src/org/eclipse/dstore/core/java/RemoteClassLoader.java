/**
 * This class loads a class from a remote peer.
 * This classloader is used just as any other classloader is used. However,
 * when instantiating the RemoteClassLoader, a DataStore is associated with
 * it. The RemoteClassLoader goes through the following steps when trying to load
 * a class:
 *  1) Attempts to load the class from memory. Any class that had been loaded
 *     already this session would reside here.
 *  2) Attempts to find the class using its parent classloader.
 *  3) If caching preference is turned on:
 *     a) Attempts to find the class from the disk cache.
 *  4) Requests the class, through the DataStore, from the remote peer. Waits for
 *     response.
 *  5) If class cannot be found, throws ClassNotFoundException
 *  6) If class is found, loads the class.
 *  7) If caching preference is turned on:
 *     a) Caches new class in the disk cache for use in the next session.
 *  Notes:
 *  i) If there are one or more classes on which the target class depends,
 *     the RemoteClassLoader will attempt to load those classes too (possibly remotely),
 *     before loading the target class.
 *  ii) Since most implementations of Java use lazy classloading, the JVM may not
 *      attempt to load all required classes for the target class during class definition
 *      or instantiation. However, if the RemoteClassLoader was used to load the target
 *      class, then at any time, any additional classes required by the target class will
 *      be loaded using the RemoteClassLoader. Clients should be aware that this could trigger
 *      class requests and class transfers during the operation of objects of the target class,
 *      not just during definition and instantiation of it.
 *  iii) On the remote peer side, if you wish a class to be a candidate for transfer using the
 *       RemoteClassLoader on the opposite side of the connection, you MUST register the classloader
 *       for that class with the DataStore corresponding to the DataStore with which the RemoteClassLoader
 *       was instantiated. For example, in a client-server connection there is a "client" DataStore and a
 *       corresponding "server" DataStore. Suppose the server wishes to use the RemoteClassLoader to load
 *       class A from the client. Suppose A is loaded on the client using ClassLoaderForA. On the client
 *       side, ClassLoaderForA must be registered with the "client" DataStore so that when the
 *       class request for A comes in from the server, the client DataStore know how to load class A.
 *
 *  Caching:
 *   To set your preference for caching, on either the client or server DataStore, use the following command:
 *    _dataStore.setPreference(RemoteClassLoader.CACHING_PREFERENCE, "true");
 *   The cache of classes is kept in a jar in the following directory:
 *   $HOME/.eclipse/RSE/rmt_classloader_cache.jar
 *   To clear the cache, you must delete the jar.
 *
 *  Threading Issues:
 *   It's safest to use the RemoteClassLoader on a separate thread, and preferably not
 *   from the CommandHandler or UpdateHandler threads. The RemoteClassLoader uses those
 *   threads to request and send the class. However, DataStore commands can be structured such that
 *   safe use of the RemoteClassLoader on these threads is possible. See below for an
 *   example.
 *
 *  Using the RemoteClassLoader in your subsystem miner:
 *   Suppose you want the client to be able to kick off a class request in your host subsystem
 *   miner. In order to accomplish this, you would take the following steps:
 *   1) Add a command to your miner in the extendSchema() method.
 *   2) Add logic in the handleCommand() method to route command to another method when handleCommand
 *      receives your new command.
 *   3) In your command handling method, get the name of the class to load from the subject
 *      DataElement.
 *   4) Load the class using the RemoteClassLoader.
 *   5) Make sure the class you are attempting to load exists on the client and that class's
 *      ClassLoader is registered with the DataStore!
