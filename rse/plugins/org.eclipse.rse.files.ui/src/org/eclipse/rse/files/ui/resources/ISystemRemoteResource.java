/**
 * This interface defines some common functionality required from all remote
 * resources, irrespective of whether the remote system is an OS/400, Windows, Linux
 * or Unix operating system. In particular, it allows users to create markers on remote
 * resources, and to create both session and persistent properties for them. A session
 * property is one that is stored only during the current workbench session, while a
 * persistent property is one that is kept between sessions. 
 * Clients must not implement this interface.
