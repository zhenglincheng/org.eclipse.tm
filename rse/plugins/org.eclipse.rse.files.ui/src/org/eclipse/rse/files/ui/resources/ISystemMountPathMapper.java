/**
 * This interface is used to provide a common way of mapping mounted resources to the temp files project.
 * Since local (or remote) mounts can change or be removed (i.e. disconnected) this provides a way for a vendor to
 * remap a particular resource if the vendor software is able to determine the new mount location.
 * 
 * There are a number of use cases where a customized workspace mapping would be desirable:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Two connections to the same host using different user IDs for each connection.  In that case, it may make
 *   sense to store the temp files differently for each connection (for example, qualified by user ID).
 *   <li>If port-forwarding is used then a port could be used to qualify the temp file path.
 *   <li>If the remote path contains invalid characters for the local file system, then the temp file mapping could 
 *   be made such that invalid characters ( e.g. :<>?* on Windows) translate to a sequence of valid characters on the client.   
 * </ul>
 * 
 * 
 * Implementors of this interface should register their mappers via the mountPathMappers extension point.
