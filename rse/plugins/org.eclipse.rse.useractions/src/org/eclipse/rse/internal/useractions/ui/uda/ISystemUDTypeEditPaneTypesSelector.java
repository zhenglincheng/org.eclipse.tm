 * Within the Work With Files Types dialog is an edit pane
 *  ({@link org.eclipse.rse.internal.useractions.ui.uda.SystemUDTypeEditPane})
 *  that contains an entry field for the name, and then one or 
 *  more widgets that prompt for the file types that constitute
 *  this named type.
 * <p>
 * This is interface abstracts out the minimal requirements for that
 *  set of widgets, so that it can be pluggable by subsystems wishing
 *  to supply customer widgets. These could be as simple as an entry
 *  field or as complex as a checkbox viewer with add and remove
 *  buttons. As far as the edit pane class is concerned, it need only
 *  be able to set the inputs, get the outputs and listen for changes.
