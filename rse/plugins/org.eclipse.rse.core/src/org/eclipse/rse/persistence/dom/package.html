Application programming interface for manipulating the RSE document object model.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
<p>
The package provides classes that define the document object model (DOM)
for the RSE model objects. The RSE model consists of those objects which are typically 
presented in the RSE system view. The DOM is created/updated from this model when the model is persisted.
Persistence providers will use this DOM to write a persistent form.
Likewise, the persistence provider will update or construct a DOM when restoring a model from its persistent form.
