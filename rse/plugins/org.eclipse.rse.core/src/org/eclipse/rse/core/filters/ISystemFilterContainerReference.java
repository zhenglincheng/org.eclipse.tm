 * Both ISystemFilter and ISystemFilterPool may contain filters, so the
 * common methods for filters are abstracted out in SystemFilterContainer,
 * which both classes implement.
 * Both ISystemFilterReference and ISystemFilterPoolReference hold references
 * to ISystemFilterContainer objects.
 * There are methods common to both classes, related to
 * getting an array of references to the filters that are held by the referenced
 * object.
 * This interface captures those common methods, and both 
 * SystemFilterReference and SystemFilterPoolReference
 * implement this interface and hence these methods.
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * The allowable implementations are already present in the framework.
