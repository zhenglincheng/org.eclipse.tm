 * Interface implemented by references to filter pools. Filter pools are stored at the profile
 * level, while subsystems contain references to one or more pools. A pool can be referenced
 * by multiple connections. Pools don't go away until explicitly deleted by the user, regardless
 * of their reference count.
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * The allowable implementations are already present in the framework.
 * @noextend This interface is not intended to be extended by clients.
