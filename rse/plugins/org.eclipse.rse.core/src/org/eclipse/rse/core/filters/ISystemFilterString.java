/**
 * A filter string is a pattern used by the server-side code to know what to return to
 *  the client. A filter contains one or more filter strings. Basically, its nothing more
 *  than a string, and its up to each consumer to know what to do with it. Generally,
 *  a filter string edit pane is designed to prompt the user for the contents of the 
 *  string in a domain-friendly way.
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * The allowable implementations are already present in the framework.
 * @noextend This interface is not intended to be extended by clients.
