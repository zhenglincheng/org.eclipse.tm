/**
 * A connector service provides the means of establishing a connection from a
 * subsystem (or a number of subsystems) to a target system (a host).
 * <p>
 * A connector service manages a live connection to a remote system, with
 * operations for connecting and disconnecting, and storing information
 * typically cached from a subsystem: credentials (such as a userId/password),
 * port, etc.
 * <p>
 * The SubSystem interface includes a method, getConnectorService(), which
 * returns an instance of an object that implements this interface for that
 * subsystem.
 * <p>
 * A single connector service object can be unique to a subsystem instance, but
 * it can also be shared across multiple subsystems in a single host if those
 * subsystems share a physical connection to the remote system. This sharing is
 * done using implementers of {@link IConnectorServiceManager} which are
 * returned by another getter method in SubSystem.
 *
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 *              Clients should subclass {@link AbstractConnectorService}
 *              instead.
 * @noextend This interface is not intended to be extended by clients.
