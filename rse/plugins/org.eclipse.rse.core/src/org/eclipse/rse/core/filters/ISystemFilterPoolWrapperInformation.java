 * The system filter wizard allows callers to pass a list of wrapper objects for

 * to filter pools. This requires an array of wrapper objects, and requires
 * replacement text for the pool prompt and tooltip text, and the verbiage above
 * it.
 * <p>
 * This is all encapsulated in this interface. There is also a class offered
 * that implements all this and is populated via setters.
