 * Interface implemented by SubSystem objects.
 *
 * While connections contain information to identify a particular remote system,
 * it is the subsystem objects within a connection that contain information
 * unique to a particular tool for that remote system, such as the port the tool
 * uses and the user ID for making the connection. There are a set of default
 * properties, but these can be extended by subsystem providers, by extending
 * SubSystem.
 *
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 *              Clients must extend the abstract <code>SubSystem</code> class
 *              instead.
