/**
 * An interface for classes that instantiate SystemFilterPoolManager objects.
 * This is the "caller" and as is recorded and recoverable from any object within
 * the filter framework. This enables callers to get back instances of themselves
 * given any filter object. Important when enabling UI actions against user
 * selected filter framework objects
 * <p>
 * Further, the goal is the allow all the filter framework UI actions to work 
 * independently, able to fully handle all actions without intervention on the
 * provider's part. However, often the provider needs to be informed of all events
 * in order to fire events to update its GUI. So this interface captures those 
 * callbacks that done to the provider for every interesting event. Should you 
 * not care about these, supply empty shells for these methods.
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * @noextend This interface is not intended to be extended by clients.
