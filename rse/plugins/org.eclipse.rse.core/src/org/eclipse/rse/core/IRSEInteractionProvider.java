/**
 * Interaction Provider Interface.
 *
 * Classes implementing this interface provide a means for RSE to communicate
 * with the outside world: via progress monitors, events and messages. A UI
 * implementation of this interface would typically use UI components for user
 * interaction; although this can be changed also intermittently.
 *
 * Non-UI headless applications may log messages rather than doing interactive
 * messages, and may use different Threads for sending messages.
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>EXPERIMENTAL</strong>. This class or interface has been added as
 * part of a work in progress. There is no guarantee that this API will work or
 * that it will remain the same. Please do not use this API without consulting
 * with the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/dsdp/tm/">Target Management</a>
 * team.
