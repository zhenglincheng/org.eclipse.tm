/**
 * The event IDs sent when local resources in the RSE model change. You should
 * monitor for these events in your view if you display any of the resource
 * types listed here.
 * <p>
 * To monitor, implement interface
 * {@link org.eclipse.rse.core.events.ISystemModelChangeListener} and call
 * {@link org.eclipse.rse.core.model.ISystemRegistry#addSystemModelChangeListener(ISystemModelChangeListener)}
 * and in your dispose method, call
 * {@link org.eclipse.rse.core.model.ISystemRegistry#removeSystemModelChangeListener(ISystemModelChangeListener)}.
 * <p>
 * If you are interesting in firing model change events, see
 * {@link org.eclipse.rse.core.model.ISystemRegistry#fireModelChangeEvent(int, int, Object, String)}
 * . These events will typically be signaled in an implementation of
 * ISystemRegistry.

 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * @noextend This interface is not intended to be extended by clients.
