	 * Test whether subsystems managed by this configuration support custom
	 * encodings.
	 *
	 * Encodings specify the way how binary data on the remote system is
	 * translated into Java Unicode Strings. RSE provides some means for the
	 * User to specify a particular encoding to use; typically, all subsystems
	 * that do support custom encodings specified should use the same encoding
	 * such that they can interoperate. Therefore, encodings are usually
	 * obtained from {@link IHost#getDefaultEncoding(boolean)}.
	 *
	 * It's possible, however, that a particular subsystem "knows" that its
	 * resources are always encoded in a particular way, and there is no
	 * possibility to ever change that. The Subsystem Configuration would return
	 * <code>false</code> here in this case. Another possibility is that
	 * encodings for a particular subsystem can be changed, but in a way that's
	 * different than what RSE usually does. The default case, however, should
	 * be that subsystems fall back to the setting specified by the host or its
	 * underlying system type such that existing subsystem configurations can be
	 * re-used in an environment where the encoding to use is pre-defined by the
	 * system type or host connection.
	 *
	 * If no subsystem registered against a given host supports encodings, the
	 * corresponding UI controls on the IHost level are disabled in order to
	 * avoid confusion to the user.
	 *
	 * @return <code>true<code> if the RSE mechanisms for specifying custom
	 *     encodings are observed and supported by the subsystems managed
