/**
 * An interface to encapsulate the operations required of an object which
 * supports references to it by other objects (IRSEReferencingObject).
 * This type of class needs to support maintaining an in-memory list of
 * all who reference it so that list can be following on delete and
 * rename operations.
 * <p>
 * These references are not persistent. Persistent references are managed
 * by the subtype IRSEPersistableReferencedObject.
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * The standard implementations are included in the framework.
 * @noextend This interface is not intended to be extended by clients.
