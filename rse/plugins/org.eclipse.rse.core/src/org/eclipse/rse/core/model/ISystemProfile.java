/**
 * A system profile holds definitions for hosts (connections), filter pools,
 * filters, and filter strings. It is the unit of persistence for those
 * definitions. Individual hosts and filter pool definitions always reside in a
 * profile and the profile itself is the entity that is saved and restored.
 * <p>
 * Profiles may be active or inactive. An active profile contributes its
 * definitions to RSE. When made inactive, it those definition are no longer
 * available for use.
 * <p>
 *
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * @noextend This interface is not intended to be extended by clients. The
 *           standard implementations are included in the framework.
