/**
 * A simple class that implements IRSEPersistableReferencingObject.
 * This is an object that is a shadow (reference) of a real master object
 * (IRSEPersistableReferencedObject). 
 * <p>
 * Objects of this class contain a pointer (in memory) to the master object, 
 * and a copy of this object's unique name or key (for storing on disk).
 * <p>
 * Only the name is saved to disk, and after restoring from disk, that name
 * is used to set the actual object reference.
 * <p>
 * The intention is that in your Rose model, your class extends this class.
 * Do this for any shadow/reference class which you want to persist. Use
 * a subclass of SystemPersistableReferenceManager to manage a list of these,
 * and manage the saving/restoring of that list.
 * <p>
 * <b>YOU MUST OVERRIDE resolveReferencesAfterRestore IN YOUR REFERENCE MANAGER SUBCLASS</b>
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * The standard implementations are included in the framework.
 * @noextend This interface is not intended to be extended by clients.
