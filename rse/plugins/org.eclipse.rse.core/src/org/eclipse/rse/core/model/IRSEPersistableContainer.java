 * This is the interface for all objects that contain persistent data.
 * The objects themselves may not have a persistent form, but can lie in the
 * persistence hierarchy and be reconstructed when the persistent form is restored.
 * An example of this is the SytemFilterPoolManager, which is itself not persisted, but
 * has this interface since it can be reconstructed from its ordering and exists
 * in the parent chain from SystemFilterPool to SystemProfile.
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * The standard implementations are included in the framework.
