 * Referencing objects are shadows of real objects. Typically, shadows are created
 * to enable a GUI which does not allow the same real object to appear multiple times.
 * In these cases, a unique shadow object is created for each unique instance of the
 * real object.
 * <p>
 * This interface captures the simple set of methods such a shadow must implement.
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * The standard implementations are included in the framework.
 * @noextend This interface is not intended to be extended by clients.
