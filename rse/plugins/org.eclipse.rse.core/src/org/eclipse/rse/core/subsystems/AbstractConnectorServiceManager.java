/**
 * This class is only needed if you need/want to support multiple
 *  subsystems and want them to share a single {@link org.eclipse.rse.core.subsystems.IConnectorService IConnectorService} object per 
 *  connection. This is the base connector service manager implementation
 *  that returns the same IConnectorService object for all subsystems in the
 *  same system connection, which implement a given interface. 
 * <p>
 * For this to work all your subsystem classes that wish to share the
 *  same IConnectorService object must implement a common interface of your choosing.
 * <p>
 * Another benefit of using this class or a subclass of it, is that whenever
 *  the user changes the core properties for a single subsystem (port, userId)
 *  then this manager is used to cascade that to all other subsystems in this
 *  connection which share that same common interface. This means the user can change 
 *  these properties in any one subsystem, and they are changed in all related
 *  subsystems magically. This is necessary because while these properties are
 *  persisted in the subsystem object, they really belong to the IConnectorService object,
 *  so when multiple subsystems share an IConnectorService object, changes to these properties
 *  in one subsystem need to be cascaded to the other subsystems.
 * <p>
 * Because you only need a singleton of these class, the constructor is protected.
 * <p>
 * Your subclass <b>must supply</b> a singleton factory method like the following:</p>
 * <pre><code>
 * public static MyConnectorServiceManager <b>getInstance</b>()
 *  {
 *  	if (inst == null)
 *  	  inst = new MyConnectorServiceManager();
 *  	return inst;
 *  }
 * </code></pre>
