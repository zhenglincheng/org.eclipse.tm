	 * Update a visible remote object with fresh data from a new object.
	 * <p>
	 * Short answer: treat this like clone(), and just copy any important
	 * instance variables. This allows keeping TreeItem references intact
	 * but refreshing the data shown, such that selections and expand state
	 * in the tree remain intact. 
	 * </p><p>
	 * Imagine the same remote resource is shown multiple times in the same tree view.... say
	 * because multiple filters resolve to it, or there are two connections to the same host. 
	 * Typically it is a different object in memory within the tree, but it refers to the same
	 * remote resource. <br>
	 * Now imagine one of the references is selected by the user and renamed via the rename action. This
	 * might only update the selected reference. What about the other objects which refer to the same
	 * remote resource... they need to update their in-memory "name" variable too. <br>
	 * That is what this method. Every reference to the same remote resource is found (they have the 
	 * same absolute name and come from a system with the same hostname) and this method is called
	 * on those other references. This is your opportunity to copy the attributes from the new element
	 * to the old element. 
	 * </p><p>
	 * Some view has updated the name or properties of this remote object. As a result, the 
	 * remote object's contents need to be refreshed. You are given the old remote object that has
	 * old data, and you are given the new remote object that has the new data. For example, on a
	 * rename the old object still has the old name attribute while the new object has the new 
	 * new attribute. You can copy the new name into the old object. Similar for any properties
	 * you allow the user to edit via the property sheet.
	 * </p><p>
	 * This is called by viewers like SystemView in response to rename and property change events.
	 * </p><p>
	 * @param oldElement the element that was found in the tree
	 * @param newElement the updated element that was passed in the REFRESH_REMOTE event

	 *   such as is needed on a rename of a folder, say, if the child object cache the parent folder name
