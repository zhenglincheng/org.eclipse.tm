/**
 * Sometimes configuring a filter action can take a reasonably substantial amount of 
 *  processing. For this reason, we would desire to defer that configuration, when simply
 *  filling a popup menu, until such time as the user has select to run the action. This
 *  reduces time and memory in the vast majority of cases.
 * <p>
 * To achieve this, code which populates a context menu can implement this interface, and
 *  pass it to the new filter wizard action. That action will then call back to the caller
 *  via this interface, when the action is run.
