 * This is the interface for an adapter on objects in the system viewer.

 * This interface supports a union of all the methods needed to support a TreeViewer
 *  content provider and label provider. The {@link org.eclipse.rse.internal.ui.view.SystemViewLabelAndContentProvider}
 *  delegates to objects of this interface almost completely. It gets such an
 *  object by calling:</p>
 * <pre><code>
 *  isve = object.getAdapter(ISystemViewElementAdapter.class);
 *  interestingInfo = isve.getXXXX(object);
 * </code></pre>
 * <p>
 * This interface also supports IPropertySource via inheritance, so we can feed the
 * PropertySheet.
 * </p>
 * <p>For remote resource objects, their adapter should also implement
 * {@link org.eclipse.rse.ui.view.ISystemRemoteElementAdapter}
 * </p>
 * @see org.eclipse.rse.ui.view.AbstractSystemViewAdapter
