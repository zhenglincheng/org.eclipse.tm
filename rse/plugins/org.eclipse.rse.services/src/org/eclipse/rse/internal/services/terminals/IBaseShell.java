/**
 * A basic shell, representing the connection to some process that may be
 * running local or remote. Clients may implement this interface.
 *
 * Clients implementing this interface are encouraged to extend
 * {@link PlatformObject} for providing the {@link #getAdapter(Class)}
 * functionality.
 *
 * A simple implementation of IBaseShell is the {@link ProcessBaseShell}, which
 * wraps a Java {@link java.lang.Process} object in the IBaseShell interface to
 * provide more convenient access to it through the {{@link #isActive()} and {{@link #waitFor(long)}
 * methods, as well as making it adaptable.
 *
 * The resulting IBaseShell can be decorated by clients with additional
 * functionality easily by instantiating their subclassed variant of
 * {@link BaseShellDecorator}.
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>EXPERIMENTAL</strong>. This class or interface has been added as
 * part of a work in progress. There is no guarantee that this API will work or
 * that it will remain the same. Please do not use this API without consulting
 * with the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/dsdp/tm/">Target Management</a>
