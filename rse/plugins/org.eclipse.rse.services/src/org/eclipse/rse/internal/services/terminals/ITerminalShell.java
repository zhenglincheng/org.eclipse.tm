/**
 * Interface representing a terminal connection through Streams.
 *
 * Rather than the underlying {@link IBaseShell}, an ITerminalShell connection
 * adds methods that describe the presentation of the data transmitted over its
 * Streams, as well as methods like {@link #setTerminalSize(int, int)} to change
 * the behavior of the presentation of this data. An instance of ITerminalShell
 * is typically obtained from an {@link ITerminalService}.
 *
 * In RSE, a single remote shell instance can only either support the streamed
 * ITerminalShell interface or the listener-based {@link IHostShell} interface,
 * but not both. Note, though, that with the capabilities that an ITerminalShell
 * has, it is always possible to adapt it to an IHostShell; this is typically
 * not possible the other way round. We therefore recommend extenders of RSE
 * that used to subclass IHostShell to move to the new IBaseShell /
 * ITerminalShell APIs eventually, if they can.
 *
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 *              Clients must subclass the provided {@link AbstractTerminalShell}
 *              or {@link TerminalShellDecorator} classes rather than
 *              implementing this interface directly.
 *
