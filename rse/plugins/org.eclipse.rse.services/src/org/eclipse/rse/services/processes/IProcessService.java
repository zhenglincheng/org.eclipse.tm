/**
 * An IProcessService is an abstraction of a process service that runs over some
 * sort of connection. It can be shared among multiple instances of a subsystem.
 * Each subsystem is currently responsible for layering an abstraction over
 * whatever it wants to construct as a service.
 * <p>
 * Implementers of this interface will have to either be instantiated,
 * initialized, or somehow derive a connection as part of its state.
 * 
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 *              Process service implementations must subclass
 *              {@link AbstractProcessService} rather than implementing this
 *              interface directly.
