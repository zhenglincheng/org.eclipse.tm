/**
 * A IFileService is an abstraction of a file service that runs over some sort of connection.
 * It can be shared among multiple instances of a subsystem.  At some point this file
 * service layer may become official API but for now it is experimental.  Each
 * subsystem is currently responsible for layering an abstraction over whatever it 
 * wants to construct as a service.
 * <p>
 * This is a very bare bones definition.  A real definition would probably have changed
 * terminology, use URI's rather than Strings, and have much more robust error handling.
 * </p><p>
 * Implementers of this interface will have to either be instantiated, initialized, or
 * somehow derive a connection as part of its state.
 * </p><p>
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.  File service
 * implementations must subclass {@link AbstractFileService} rather than implementing
 * this interface directly.
