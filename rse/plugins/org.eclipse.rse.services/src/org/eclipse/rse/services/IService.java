/**
 * IService is the base interface for any non-UI service contributions to RSE.
 *
 * An actual Service is free to perform any operations at all - the only
 * commonality between services is that they have a name, can be initialized,
 * and are adaptable for future extension.
 *
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 *              Service implementations must subclass
 *              {@link AbstractService} rather than implementing this
 *              interface directly.
