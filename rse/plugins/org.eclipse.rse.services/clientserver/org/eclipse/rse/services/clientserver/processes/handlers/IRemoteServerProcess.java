 * This interface represents a simple process on the remote server.
 * It is simply a data structure for the passing of information about
 * a process from the UniversalProcessMiner to the ProcessHandler
 * that actually gets all the process information. The setters all
 * take strings as input for the sake of convenience, since that is 
 * how the process information is mined. However, the getters continue
 * to return the attributes as their real data types. NOTE THAT THE SETTERS
 * HERE DO NOT ACTUALLY MODIFY ANY PROPERTIES OF THE UNDERLYING PROCESS. IN
 * ORDER TO DO THIS YOU MUST SEND THE PROCESS A KILL SIGNAL THROUGH THE
 * SUBSYSTEM.
