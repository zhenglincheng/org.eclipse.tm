/**
 * A reentrant Exclusion Lock for Threads that need to access a resource in a
 * serialized manner. If the request for the lock is running on the same thread
 * who is currently holding the lock, it will "borrow" the lock, and the call to
 * waitForLock() will go through. A SystemOperationMonitor is accepted in order
 * to support cancellation when waiting for the Mutex. This is a clone of
 * {@link org.eclipse.rse.services.Mutex} with some modification to make sure the
 * sequential calls to waitForLock() method in the same thread will not be
 * blocked.
 * 
 * Usage Example: <code>
 *    private SystemReentrantMutex fooMutex = new SystemReentrantMutex();
 *    boolean doFooSerialized()(ISystemOperationMonitor monitor) {
 *    	  int mutexLockStatus = SystemReentrantMutex.LOCK_STATUS_NOLOCK;
 *        mutexLockStatus = fooMutex.waitForLock(monitor, 1000);
 *        if (mutexLockStatus != SystemReentrantMutex.LOCK_STATUS_NOLOCK) {
 *            try {
 *                return doFoo();
 *            } finally {
 *                //We only release the mutex if we acquire it, not borrowed it.
 *   	          if (mutexLockStatus == SystemReentrantMutex.LOCK_STATUS_AQUIRED)
 * 		          {
 * 			          fooMutex.release();
 * 		          }
 *            }
 *        }
 *        return false;
 *    }
 * </code>
