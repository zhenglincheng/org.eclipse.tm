Application programming interface for creating customized local process subsystems.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
The package provides support classes for creating customized local process
subsystems.
<p>The class <b>LocalProcessSubSystemConfiguration</b> is the main factory
for creating a local process subsystem. By deriving from it, extenders
can create their customized local process subsystem configuration which can 
then be registered against their system types. A custom
<b>SubSystemConfigurationAdapter</b> can be registered for UI-specific
customizations. Possible customizations include:
<ul>
<li>Changing the isCaseSensitive() method for system types that
  are not of UNIX style.</li>
<li>Registering pre-defined filters through a filter pool manager.</li>
<li>Wrapping the created ProcessServiceSubSystem or LocalProcessService in a
  delegate for modifying operation of the Subsystem.</li>
</ul>
