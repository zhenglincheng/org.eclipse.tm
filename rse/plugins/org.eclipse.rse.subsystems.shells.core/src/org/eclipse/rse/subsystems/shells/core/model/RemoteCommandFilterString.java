/**
 * A string representing a filter sent to remote file subsystems.
 * <p>
 * Filters can be absolute or relative. Absolute contains a folder path, while relative do not.
 * <p>
 * The files can be filtered by name, or by a list of file types. If by name, it can have
 *  up to 2 asterisks anywhere in the name for wildcarding. If by types, multiple types can
 *  by specified. The types are the file extensions without the dot, as in "java" or "class".
 * <p>
 * Examples:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>Absolute file name filter: <code>d:\mystuff\phil*.abc</code>
 *  <li>Relative file name filter: <code>phil*.abc</code>
 *  <li>Absolute file type filter: <code>d:\mystuff\java,class,</code>
 *  <li>Relative file type filter: <code>java,class,</code>
 * <p>
 * Syntactically, file type filter strings have at least one comma.
 * Note that the file name filter string "*.java" is semantically the same
 *  as a type filter string "java,". Either one can be used and will get
 *  the same results. However, if you specify "java" you will be in trouble,
 *  as it will mean look for a file explicitly named "java".
 * <p>
 * It is invalid to have both a comma and an asterisk in the same filter string.
 * It is also invalid to have both a comma and a period in the same filter string.
 * <p>
 * Clients may use or subclass this class. When subclassing, clients need to
 * ensure that the subclass is always capable of performing a deep clone 
 * operation with the {@link #clone()} method, so if they add fields of 
 * complex type, these need to be dealt with by overriding {@link #clone()}.
