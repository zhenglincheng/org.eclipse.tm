/**

 * @author mjberger
 * 
 * This interface represents a handle to a remote process object
 * It differs from an IHostProcess in that it contains extra, RSE-specific
 * information.
 * <ul>
 *   <li>This is an interface, so there are no static methods
 *   <li>This are no action methods, only read methods. The action methods
 *        such as kill are found in the process subsystem interface.
 *        All remote commands/actions are funnelled through subsystems in this
 *        remote system framework.
 *   <li>Similarly, you do not construct these objects directly. Rather, there are
 *        factory methods in IRemoteProcessSubSystem to create them.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
