Application programming interface for creating customized DataStore shell subsystems.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
The package provides support classes for creating customized DataStore shell
subsystems.
<p>The class <b>DStoreShellSubSystemConfiguration</b> is the main factory
for creating an DataStore shell subsystem. By deriving from it, extenders
can create their customized DataStore shell subsystem configuration which can 
then be registered against their system types. A custom
<b>SubSystemConfigurationAdapter</b> can be registered for UI-specific
customizations. Possible customizations include:
<ul>
<li>Changing the isCaseSensitive() method for system types that
  are not of UNIX style.</li>
<li>Registering pre-defined filters through a filter pool manager.</li>
<li>Wrapping the created ShellServiceSubSystem or DStoreShellService
  in a delegate for modifying operation of the Subsystem.</li>
</ul>
