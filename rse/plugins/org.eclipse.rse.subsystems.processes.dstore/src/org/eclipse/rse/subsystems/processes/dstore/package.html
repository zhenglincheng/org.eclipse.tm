Application programming interface for creating customized DataStore process subsystems.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
The package provides support classes for creating customized DataStore process
subsystems.
<p>The class <b>DStoreProcessSubSystemConfiguration</b> is the main factory
for creating a DataStore process subsystem. By deriving from it, extenders
can create their customized DataStore process subsystem configuration which can 
then be registered against their system types. A custom
<b>SubSystemConfigurationAdapter</b> can be registered for UI-specific
customizations. Possible customizations include:
<ul>
<li>Changing the isCaseSensitive() method for system types that
  are not of UNIX style.</li>
<li>Registering pre-defined filters through a filter pool manager.</li>
<li>Wrapping the created ProcessServiceSubSystem or DStoreProcessService 
  in a delegate for modifying operation of the Subsystem.</li>
</ul>
