The view allows them to be sorted by clicking on the column headings,     run individually, run in batches, run in the background or in the UI thread.     You can reset the tests and re-run them. This is useful when debugging the     function driven by a test, when debugging the test itself, or when testing varitions     between intial and subsequent runs. You can also see the test results of any test     suite that has been run.</p>    <p>To open the Test Suite View use the Window -> Show View -> Other... menu     item and select the Test Suites View from the Testing category.</p>    <h3>Columns</h3>    <p>The <strong>Graphic</strong> column shows the status of the test.     It show a question mark if the test has not been run or has been reset,     a red X if the test suite has a test case that has failed or produced an exception,     and a green check if the test has run to completion. In keeping with the philosophy     of JUnit it is updated as the test suite is run so you know immediately if there     are any failures.</p>    <p>The <strong>Test Suite</strong> columns show the name of the test suite.</p>    <p>The <strong>Summary</strong> column is blank if the test has not yet been run.     It shows the number of test cases run, the number failed, and the number of     unexpected errors. It is updated as the test suite is run.</p>    <p>The <strong>Time Run</strong> column is blank if the test has not yet been run.     It shows the time the test suite began running, not the time it finished.</p>    <h3>Actions</h3>    <p>You bring up a context menu containing the test suite actions by selecting a test     suite (or several) and right-clicking. The actions may be grayed out if     they are not available for that particular selection of tests. You select tests     by clicking on them. You can add test suites to (and remove test suites from)     the selection by using control-click. You can select a     range of tests by using shift-click.</p>    <dl>        <dt>Select All</dt>        <dd>The "Select All" action selects all the test suites in the view.         It is available no matter how many test suites are currently selected.</dd>        <dt>Run</dt>        <dd>This action will run the selected test suites, in the order in which         they are presented in the list. The suites are run in an eclipse "job"         that can be relegated to the background. The Test Suite View is busy while         the tests are being run. This action is available if there is at least one         test suite selected.</dd>        <dt>Reset</dt>        <dd>The "Reset" action will erase the results of the selected test suites         and show them as "not yet run". It is available if there is at least one         test suite selected.</dd>    </dl>    <h3>The Results Pane</h3>    <img src="ResultsPane.png" alt="Results Pane" />    <p>The <strong>Results Pane</strong> shows the results of a test suite that has     been run. Each test case in the suite has an entry that shows its success or     failure with any remarks generated by a testcase during its run.     If the test case fails, the entry shows the reason for the failure along with the     stack trace for the exception. The results pane may be copied so you can place     it in a defect or an e-mail.</p>    <p>You can move the divider between the Test Suite Pane and the Results Pane up and     down as necessary.</p></body></html>
