    <h2>Future Items</h2>
    <h3>Semi-Automatic Tests</h3>
    <p>Scriptable tests would run in the background, but would interact with the user 
    on a step by step basis. The steps would be externally defined and contain an image 
    (perhaps a screen shot) and some instructions. The user would follow the instructions 
    and provide feedback along the way as the test was run. The user could pass or 
    fail the test at any point. This would allow for script driven user-interface 
    testing suitable for TVT, CRT, and GVT kinds of tests.</p>
